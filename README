My solution to exercise 3 from Accelerated C++. 

You were asked to make a program which takes in any amount of numbers and then print them out in their quartiles.

I've done this using vectors to store the numbers, then sort them using the built in function included in <algorithm>. I then call my own function which prints out numbers which are between 2 indexes input as parameters.
